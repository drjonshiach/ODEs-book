# Deriving order conditions using trees

In the [previous section](rk2-derivation-section) we saw that to derive an Explicit Runge-Kutta (ERK) method we equate [Taylor series](taylor-series-section) expansions of the ODE $y'=f(t,y)$ and the [general form of a Runge-Kutta method](general-form-of-a-RK-method-section) to derive a set of order condtions which need to be satisfied. This means we need to evaluate the derivatives of the bivariate function $f(t,y)$ which can soon get complicated as we increase the order. To simplify the derivation we consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(mathematics)" target="_blank">autonomous system</a> of the form $y'=f(y)$. Applying the product and chain rules to evaluate the derivatives

$$ \begin{align*}
    y' &= f(y), \\
    y'' &= f'(y)y' \\
    &= (f'f)(y), \\
    y''' &= f''(y)(f(y), f'(y)) + f'(y)f'(y)y' \\
    &= (f''(f,f) + f'f'f)(y) \\
    &\vdots
\end{align*}$$ (derivatives-of-fy)

So we can see this soon gets quite complicated. Fortunately there is an easier way that uses rooted trees.

## Trees

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)#Rooted_tree" target="_blank">**rooted tree**</a> is a tree where a single node is designated as the **root**. Rooted trees are usually drawn with the root node at the bottom of the tree.

We now define the properties of order and density of a rooted tree

:::{prf:definition} Order of a rooted tree
:label: order-of-a-rooted-tree-definition

The order, $r$, of a rooted tree is the total number of nodes in the tree.
:::

:::{prf:definition} Density of a rooted tree
:label: density-of-a-rooted-tree-definition

The density, $\gamma$, of a rooted tree is a measure related to the number of nodes and the children of the notes in the tree. The density can be calculated using the following:

- assign a value of 1 to each leaf node (a node with no children) in the tree;
- for all non-leaf nodes assign a value of 1 more than the sum of the values of their child nodes;
- calculate the product the values of all nodes in the tree which gives $\gamma$.

Determine the order and density of the rooted tree shown below.

::::{dropdown} Solution
There are 7 nodes in this tree so $r=7$.

Assigning the weights to the nodes gives

So $\gamma = 7 \cdot 1 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 42$

### Determining derivatives of $f(y)$ using rooted trees

 English mathematician Robert Merson {cite:p}`merson:1957` noticed that the structure of rooted trees matches that of the derivatives of $f(y)$. Defining a rooted tree notation where $\mathbf{f}$ denotes a node of the tree and the number of children the node has is denoted by a prime, e.g., $\mathbf{f}''$ denotes a node has two children. A child node is written immediately following the parent node and sibling nodes are separated by a comma (using brackets if there are more than one child). A rooted tree can be represented as an expressing involving each node, examples of this are given in {numref}`order-3-trees`.

:::

So how do rooted trees relate to the derivatives of $f(y)$? Consider the only rooted tree of order 2 which is $\mathbf{f}'\mathbf{f}$. If we write $\mathbf{f} = f(y)$ then

$$\mathbf{f}'\mathbf{f} = f'f(y)$$

which as we saw in equation {eq}`derivatives-of-fy` is equal to $y''$ when $y' = f(y)$. We can extend this to determine the derivative $y'''$, the two rooted trees of order 3 are $\mathbf{f}''(\mathbf{f},\mathbf{f})$ and $\mathbf{f}'\mathbf{f}'\mathbf{f}$. Summing these gives

$$ \mathbf{f}''(\mathbf{f},\mathbf{f}) + \mathbf{f}'\mathbf{f}'\mathbf{f} = (f''(f,f) + f'f'f)(y) = y'''$$

So we can determine the $N$-th derivative $y^{(N)}$ where $y'=f(y)$ by summing the rooted tree notation of all of the possible $N$-th order rooted trees.

## Order conditions of an ERK method using trees

We can also derive the order conditions of a Runge-Kutta method using rooted trees. To determine the values of $a_{ij}$, $b_i$ and $c_i$ in the Butcher tableau we define a set of **elementary weights**, denoted by $\Phi$, that are generated by the rooted trees using the following process:

- associate the label $i$ to the root node and for each other non-leaf node associate unique labels $j$, $k$, etc;
- write down a sequence of factors for which the first is $b_i$;
- for each edge that does not terminate in a leaf node, write down another factor $a_{pq}$ where $p$ and $q$ are the labels associated with the parent and child node respectively;
- for each leaf node write down a factor $c_p$ where $p$ is the label associated with the parent node;
- sum the product of factors for all possible choices of the labels.

Determine the elementary weight for the rooted tree shown below.

Assigning the labels to the non-leaf nodes gives

So the elementary weight is

$$ \begin{align*}
    \Phi &= \sum_{i,j,k} b_ia_{ij} a_{ik} c_ic_jc_jc_k
    =  \sum_{i,j,k} b_ia_{ij} a_{ik} c_ic_j^2c_k.
\end{align*} $$

John Butcher noticed that comparing the Taylor series expansions for the autonomous ODE $y'=f(y)$ and the general form of a Runge-Kutta method gives the order condition [^1]

[^1]: I've skipped the derivation here, for details see {cite:t}`butcher:2008`.

$$\Phi = \dfrac{1}{\gamma}.$$(order-condition-relation)

To derive the order conditions for a $n$-th order $s$-stage Runge-Kutta method we do the following:

- determine the set $T$ of all rooted trees of order up to and including $n$;
- determine the density and elementary weights (summed to $s$) for all trees in $T$;
- use equation {eq}`order-condition-relation` to determine the order condition for each tree in $T$;
- if we don't have order conditions that include all of the unknowns we apply the row sum condition which is

$$c_i = \sum_{j=1}^sa_{ij}$$(row-sum-condition)

:::::{prf:example}
:label: rk2-order-condition-derivation

Use trees to derive the order conditions for a 2-stage second-order explicit Runge-Kutta method.

The set of all rooted trees up to and including order 2 are

Using equation {eq}`order-condition-relation` and summing the elementary weights to $s=2$ the order conditions for a second-order method are

$$ \begin{align*}
    b_1 + b_2 &= 1, \\
    b_1c_1 + b_2c_2 &= \frac{1}{2}.
\end{align*} $$

We also need to determine a value for $a_{21}$ which isn't included in the order conditions above. Using the row sum condition for the second row we have 

$$ \begin{align*}
    a_{21} = c_2.
\end{align*} $$

We now have the three order conditions for a second-order ERK method which were derived in the [previous section](rk2-derivation-section).
