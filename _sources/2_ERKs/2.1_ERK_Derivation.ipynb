    "## Using Python and MATLAB to solve the order conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "The algebra used to solve the order conditions in [example 2.2](#rk2-derivation-example) above is quite easy to perform but for higher order methods it can soon get more complicated (see the [derivation of a fourth-order explicit Runge-Kutta method](#rk4-derivation-example) for an example) and it is therefore useful to use software to help with the algebra. There is a Python library called [**SymPy**](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) (short for *symbolic Python*) that has functions that can solve algebraic equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code below derives the second-order explicit Runge-Kutta method from [example 2.2](#rk2-derivation-example) using SymPy. After importing SymPy we need to declare each of the coefficients $a_{21}$, $b_1$, $b_2$ and $c_2$ as **symbolic variables** using the `sp.symbols` command before setting $c_2=1$. Each order condition is then defined using these symbolic variables. Note that SymPy assumes that equations are equal to zero which is why we have subtracted the right-hand side. We have also used the `sp.Rational(1,2)` command for the fraction $\\frac{1}{2}$ so that SymPy will output any fractional values as fractions rather than decimals. The system of three equations `eq1`, `eq2` and `eq3` is then solved using the `sp.solve` command."
