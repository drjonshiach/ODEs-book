    "Indirect methods for solving systems of linear equations use an iterative approach to repeatedly update estimates of the exact solution to the linear system. They are called **indirect methods** since multiple applications of the method is required to calculate a solution unlike [matrix decomposition methods](matrix-decomposition-chapter) such as Gaussian elimination and [LU decomposition](lu-section) which require a single application to calculate the solution. However, direct methods are inefficient for large systems of equations for which we tend to use indirect methods instead. \n",

    "where $\\vec{x}^{(k)}$ and $\\vec{x}^{(k+1)}$ are the current and improved estimates of $\\vec{x}$ respectively, $T$ is an **iteration matrix** and $\\vec{c}$ is some vector. This equation is iterated updating the values of the estimates such that $\\vec{x}^{(k)} \\to \\vec{x}$ as $k\\to \\infty$. Note that unlike direct methods which will calculate the exact solution, indirect only calculate an estimate (albeit very close) of the exact solution.\n",
