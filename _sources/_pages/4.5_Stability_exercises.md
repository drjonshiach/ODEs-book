$$ \begin{array}{c|cc}
    1/4 & 7/24 & -1/24\\
    3/4 & 13/24 & 5/24\\ \hline
    & 1/2 & 1/2
\end{array} $$
```

```{exercise}
:label: ch2-ex-dirk-stability-function

Plot the region of absolute stability for the following Runge-Kutta method.

$$ \begin{array}{c|cc}
    1/3 & 1/3 & 0\\
    1 & 1 & 0\\ \hline
    & 3/4 & 1/4
\end{array} $$
```

```{exercise}
:label: ch4-ex-stiffness-ratio

Calculate the stiffness ratio for the following system of ODEs. 

\begin{align*}
    y_1' &= -80.6 y_1 + 119.4 y_2,\\
    y_2' &= 79.6 y_1 - 120.4 y_2.
\end{align*}

What are the maximum step lengths that the Euler method is stable for solving each equation?
