# Implicit Runge-Kutta methods exercises

Answer the following exercises based on the content from this chapter. The solutions can be found in the [appendices](irk-solutions-section).

```{exercise}
:label: ch3-ex-radauIA-order

Determine the order of the DIRK shown below.

$$ \begin{array}{c|cc}
    1/4 & 1/4 \\
    3/4 & 1/2 & 1/4 \\ \hline
    & 1/2 & 1/2
\end{array} $$
```

```{exercise}
:label: ch3-ex-radauIIA-derivation

Derive a third-order Radau IIA method.
```

```{exercise}
:label: ch3-ex-radauIIA-step1

Calculate the first step of the third-order Radau IIA method derived in {numref}`ch3-ex-radauIIA-derivation` to solve the following initial value problem using a step length of $h=0.4$ and a accuracy tolerance of $tol = 10^{-4}$

\begin{align*}
  y' =t - y, \qquad t \in [0,2], \qquad y(0) = 1.
\end{align*}
```

```{exercise}
:label: ch3-ex-radauIIA

The exact solution to the IVP in {numref}`ch3-ex-radauIIA-step1` is $y = t + 2e^{-t} - 1$. Write a program to this initial value problem over the full domain, produce a table comparing the numerical and exact solutions and plot the numerical solutions and exact solutions on the same set of axes.
