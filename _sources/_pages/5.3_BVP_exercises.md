Answer the following exercises based on the content from this chapter. The solutions can be found in the [appendices](bvp-solutions-section).

```{exercise}
:label: ch5-ex-uniqueness

Determine which of the following BVPs have a unique solution

(a) &emsp; $y'' = - \dfrac{4}{t} y' + \dfrac{2}{t^2 } y - \dfrac{2\ln (t)}{t^3 }, \qquad y(1) = 1/2, \qquad y(2) = \ln (2)$;

(b) &emsp; $y'' = e^t + y\cos(t) - (t + 1) y', \qquad y(0) = 1, \qquad y(2) = \ln(3)$;

(c) &emsp; $y'' = (t^3 + 5)y + \sin(t), \qquad y(0) = 0,\qquad y(1) = 1$;

(d) &emsp; $y'' = (5y + \sin(3t)) e^t, \qquad y(0) = 0,\qquad y(1) = 0$.

```{exercise}
:label: ch2-ex-bvp-hand-calc

Consider the following boundary value problem

$$ y'' = 2t, \qquad y(0) = 1, \qquad y(2) = 3. $$

Using a pen and calculator, calculate the Euler method solutions using a step length of $h=0.4$ and guess values of $y'(0) = 1$ and $y'(0) = -1$.

```{exercise}
:label: ch2-ex-bvp-secant

Use the Secant method to calculate the next value of $s$ for your solutions to the boundary value problem in {numref}`ch2-ex-bvp-hand-calc` and hence calculate the Euler method using this new guess value.
```

```{exercise}
:label: ch2-ex-bvp-finite-difference
        
Calculate the solution of the boundary value problem in {numref}`ch2-ex-bvp-hand-calc` using the finite-difference method with a step length $h=0.4$.
```

```{exercise}
:label: ch5-ex-python

The exact solution to the boundary value problem in {numref}`ch2-ex-bvp-hand-calc` is $y = \frac{1}{3} t^3 - \frac{1}{3} t + 1$. Write a Python or MATLAB program to perform the numerical calculations for {numref}`ch2-ex-bvp-secant` and {numref}`ch2-ex-bvp-finite-difference` and produce a plot of the numerical solutions and the exact solutions on the same set of axes. Comment on your plot.
