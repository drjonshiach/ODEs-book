# Introduction

These are the lecture notes that accompany the teaching of Runge-Kutta methods and computational linear algebra on the third year of the Mathematics course at the Manchester Metropolitan university. They can be accessed through a standard web browser on a computer or mobile device. Whilst these notes cover all of the material necessary for students to successfully pass the unit, it is advisable to seek out other sources of information either on the internet or textbooks. Mathematical notation can differ between authors and these notes have been written to use notation that is most commonly found online.

## Runge-Kutta methods

The content for this half of the unit is split into two main topic areas. The first deals with Runge-Kutta methods which are the most common method used to solve ordinary differential equations.

## Linear Algebra

The other topic area that is covered in this half of the unit is the solution of linear systems of equations. There are two approaches to this, direct methods are algebraic methods that require a single application to solve a linear system. An example of a direct method is Gaussian elimination. The other approach is indirect methods which uses multiple iterations to improve on a guess of the solution until it is achieved a level of accuracy.

Students are advised to read through the relevant section of the lecture notes prior to attending the lecture. Do not worry about trying to understand everything when you first read through them. Reading mathematics is not like reading a novel, it often requires repeated reading of a passage before you fully grasp the concepts that are being explained. In the lectures we will explain the various topics and provide more insight than what is written in the notes. 

The exercises contained in this book have the solutions hidden from the reader by default but can be revealed by clicking on the drop down link. Readers are advised to avoid the temptation of accessing the solutions before an attempt has been made to answer the questions.
