    "The area of mathematics dealing with describing geometry in terms of **coordinate systems**, hence as points and vectors, is called **Cartesian geometry** (named after French mathematician Ren\\'{e} Descartes) or **coordinate geometry**. In this chapter we systematise the basic knowledge and understanding of the terms **point**, **line** and **plane**.\n"
