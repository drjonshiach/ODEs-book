    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the lecture notes that accompany the Linear Algebra part of the unit Linear Algebra and Programming Skills. Students are provided with a printed copy of the lecture notes so that they can focus on what is being covered in the lecture without having to worrying about making their own notes. There is also an electronic copy in PDF format which is available on the moodle area for this unit. These notes are quite comprehensive and are written specifically for this unit so should serve as your main point of reference. However, it is always advisable to seek out other sources of information either on the internet or better still textbooks from the library. Mathematical notation can differ between authors and these notes have been written to use notation that is most commonly found online.\n",
    "\n",
    "These notes use a tried and tested format of definition (what is it that we are studying?) $\\to$ explanation (why do we use it?) $\\to$ examples (how is it used?) $\\to$ exercises (now you try it). The examples in the printed version of the notes are left empty for students to complete in class. This is done because by writing out the steps used in a method it helps students to better understand that method. The PDF version of the notes contains the full solutions to the examples so if you do happen to miss an example you can complete the example by looking it up in the PDF version.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should read through the lecture notes prior to attending the lectures that focus on that particular chapter. Don't worry about trying to understand everything when you first read through them. Reading mathematics is not like reading your favourite novel, it often requires repeated reading of a passage before you fully grasp the concepts that are being explained. In the lectures we will explain the various topics and provide more insight than what is written in the notes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF version of the notes contains lots of hyperlinks for easy navigation around the document. Hyperlinks show up as blue text and can save lots of time scrolling up and down the pages.\n",

    "- **Coursework (50%)**\n",
    "    - Released to students on **????**;\n",
    "    - Deadline is **????**;\n",

    "## Python and MATLAB\n",
    "\n",
    "All tutorial exercises and assessment questions for the linear algebra part of this unit can be done using a pen and paper, however, it is a good idea to become proficient in using mathematical software to help check your calculations. In the programming skills part of this unit you will be taught how to use Python and MATLAB, so these notes contain brief explanations how the various calculations can be achieved using this software. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is open source software which means it is free to download and install on your home machine. The best we to do this is to visit the website linked to below and download the Individual Edition of the Anaconda suite of programs. Once installed, you can use \\href{https://jupyter.org}{Jupyter Notebooks} to run Python commands (this is what you will be using in the programming skills part of the unit) or \\href{https://www.spyder-ide.org}{Spyder} which is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download and install Python on your computer\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org/) is free for you to download and install on your own computer. There are many different ways which you can do this but perhaps the simplest is to download and install [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). Anaconda is a suite of programs which includes Python and Jupyter Notebook which you can use to write Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download and install MATLAB on your computer\n",
    "\n",
    "As a student of Manchester Met, you can download and install a free copy of [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) on your own computer by following the instructions found [here](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/about-us/professional-services/isds/software/software-download-centre//matlab.php).\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if you get confused with the Python and MATLAB commands, you will be given help on how to use the software in the programming skills part of the unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advice to students\n",
    "\n",
    "Some general advice to students:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attend all of the classes** -- the key to successfully passing the unit is to attend all of your classes. Mathematics is not a subject that can be learned easily in isolation just by reading the lecture notes. You will get much more out of the unit by attending, and more importantly, actively engaging in the classes.  \n",
    "- **Complete all of the exercises** -- you would not expect an athlete to get faster or stronger without exercising and the same applies to studying mathematics. The tutorial exercises are designed to give you practice at using the various techniques and to help you to fully grasp the content. Try to make sure that you complete all of the exercises before the following week's lectures. Full worked solutions are provided in \\Cref{cha:exercise solutions} at the end of these notes but do try to be disciplined and avoid looking up the answers before you have attempted the questions. \n",
    "- **Catch up on missed work** -- for whatever reason there may be a day when you cannot attend your classes, if this happens make sure you make the effort to catch up on missed work. Read through the appropriate chapter in the notes (as specified in the teaching schedule), complete the examples and attempt the tutorial exercises. It is very easy to start falling behind and the longer you leave it the more difficult it will be to catch up.\n",
    "- **Start the coursework as soon as you are able** -- the coursework is released to students early in the teaching block so you are not expected to be able to answer all of the questions right away. As we progress through the unit you will be told which questions you should now be able to answer. Try to start these questions as soon as you can and not leave it to the last minute.\n",
    "- **Ask questions!** -- perhaps the most important piece of advice here, there will be times when you are not quite sure about a concept, application or question. You can ask for help from the teaching staff and your fellow students. Mathematics is a hierarchical subject which means it requires full understanding at a fundamental level before moving onto more advanced topics, so if there are any gaps in your knowledge don't be afraid to ask questions. \n",
