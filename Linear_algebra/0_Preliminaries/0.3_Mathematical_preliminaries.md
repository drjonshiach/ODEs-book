# Mathematical preliminaries

It is assumed that readers are familiar with the following definitions.

## Sets of numbers

The following notation is used to denote the [sets of numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)#Special_sets_of_numbers_in_mathematics)

- $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers: $\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, \ldots\}$
- $\mathbb{Z}$ is the set of integer numbers: $\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots \}$
- $\mathbb{Q}$ is the set of rational numbers: $\mathbb{Q} = \left\{ \dfrac{a}{b} : a, b \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}$
- $\mathbb{R}$ is the set of real numbers: $\mathbb{R} = \{ -\infty, \ldots, \infty\}$
- $\mathbb{C}$ is the set of complex numbers: $\mathbb{C} = \{ a + bi : a, b \in \mathbb{R}, i = \sqrt{-1} \}$

## Axioms of addition and multiplication

The following nine axioms[^1] apply to addition and multiplication, denoted by $+$ and $\cdot$ respectively, over a field $F$ (e.g., $F$ could be the set of all numbers). For every $x,y,z \in F$:

[^1]: An axiom is a rule that we assume is true for a starting point for further reasoning and arguments.

- **Commutativity of addition**: $x + y = y + x$
- **Associativity of addition**: $x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z$
- **Additive neutral element**: there exists an element $0$ such that $x + 0 = x$
- **Additive inverse**: there exists an element $-x$ such that $x + (-x) = 0$
- **Commutativity of multiplication**: $x \cdot y = y \cdot z$
- **Associativity of multiplication**: $x \cdot (y \cdot z) = (x \cdot y) \cdot z$
- **Multiplicative identity**: there exists an element $1$ such that $1 \cdot x = x$
- **Multiplicative inverse**: there exists an element $1/x$ such that $x \cdot \dfrac{1}{x} = 1$
- **Distributive law**: $x \cdot (y + z) = x \cdot y + x \cdot z$

Note that the multiplication operator $\cdot$ is often omitted, i.e., $x \cdot y = xy$.

## Imaginary numbers 

The [**imaginary number**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number) is denoted by $i$ (some disciplines use $j$ to denote the imaginary number) and defined to be $i^2 = -1$. [**Complex numbers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number) are numbers of the form $a + bi$ where $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$ and $a$ is called the **real part** and $b$ is called the **imaginary part**.

## Summation 

The [sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation) of $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ is denoted using

$$\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n,$$

where the uppercase Greek letter sigma $\Sigma$ denotes the summation, the subscript $i=1$ indicates that the summation begins at the element indexed $i=1$, and the superscript $n$ indicates that the summation end at the element indexed $i=n$.
