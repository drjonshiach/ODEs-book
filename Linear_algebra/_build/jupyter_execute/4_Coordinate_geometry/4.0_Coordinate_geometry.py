# ## Definition
# 
# The area of mathematics dealing with describing geometry in terms of **coordinate systems**, hence as points and vectors, is called **Cartesian geometry** (named after French mathematician and philosopher [Ren√© Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes)) or **coordinate geometry**. In this chapter we systematise the basic knowledge and understanding of the terms **point**, **line** and **plane**.
# 
# (points-section)=
# ## Points in $\mathbb{R}^n$
# 
# In his works the *Elements*, Euclid described a *point* as *"that which has no part"*
# A point has position only, it has no length, width or thickness, and thus no area or volume. As we've already seen, a typical point in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is described by its co-ordinates $(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)$, where the $a_i \in \mathbb{R}$. We also think of $\mathbb{R}^0$ as a single point. This might seem a bit strange because what does a $0$-tuple even mean? However, it makes sense for us to adopt this absolutely standard convention.
# 
# 
# (lines-section)=
# ## Lines in $\mathbb{R}^n$
# 
# Euclid defined a line as having *"breadthless length"* which is another way of saying a line is a one dimensional object that has a length but no breadth or volume. Given that we have already taken the time to introduce vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ in [Vectors](vectors-chapter) it makes sense to use them to define what it means to be a line in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

# 
# Let $P = (p_1, \ldots ,p_n)$ be a point in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbf{d} = (d_1, \ldots, d_n)$ a non-zero vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The line $\ell$ [^1] which passes through $P$ in the direction of $\mathbf{d}$ has equation
# 
# :::{math}
# :label: line-vector-equation
# 
# Q = P + t\mathbf{d},
# :::
# where $Q$ is a general point on $\ell$ and $t\in \mathbb{R}$ is known as a **parameter**.
# ::::
# 
# [^1]: $\ell$ is used here instead of $l$ to avoid confusing with a 1 or uppercase i.
# 
# In other words, every point on $\ell$ is obtained by adding some scalar multiple of $\mathbf{d}$ to $P$ ({numref}`line-vector-equation-figure`). So $\ell$ is the line which passes through $P$ in the direction of $\mathbf{d}$. We call the vector $\mathbf{d}$ a **direction vector** of the line.
# 
# :::{figure} ../Images/line_vector_equation.png
# :name: line-vector-equation-figure
# 
# The position of any point on the line $\ell$ can be obtained by adding a scalar multiple of $\mathbf{d}$ to $P$.
# :::
# 
# In practice one can determine the direction vector $\mathbf{d}$ of a line by taking any two distinct points $P_1$ and  $P_2$ on $\ell$ and setting $\mathbf{d}=P_2 - P_1$ and $P$ in the line equation to be any point on the line. In particular, $\mathbf{d}$ and $P$ are not unique. If fact, one could choose any non-zero scalar multiple of $\mathbf{d}$ to express the same line. Take for instance the $x$-axis in $\mathbb{R}^3$. $\ell$ can be described as
# 
# \begin{align*}
#    Q = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} t \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},
# \end{align*}
# 
# which means we are taking $P=(0,0,0)$ and $\mathbf{d}=(1,0,0)$ and for example the point $Q=(5,0,0)$ is found when $t=5$. Alternatively we can describe the $x$-axis as 
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     Q = \begin{pmatrix} 71 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 71 + 5t \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},
# \end{align*} 
# 
# which means we are taking $P=(71,0,0)$ and $\mathbf{d}=(5,0,0)$ and the point $Q = (5,0,0)$ is found when $71 +5t = 5 \implies t = -\dfrac{66}{5}$.

# In practice the condition from the [definition of parallel lines](parallel-lines-definition) can be verified as follows: two lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are parallel if for any two distinct points $P_1, P_2 \in \ell_1$ and any two distinct points $Q_1, Q_2 \in \ell_2$

# (ii) &emsp; show that these lines are not parallel in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
# 
# ::::{dropdown} Solutions
# 
# (i) &emsp; To calculate the direction vector $\mathbf{d}$ we need two points on the line. Choosing $x=0$ and $x=1$ then we have the two points $P_1 = (0, 0, 1)$ and $P_2 = (1, 0, 2)$ on $\ell_1$. Therefore
# \begin{align*}
#     \mathbf{d} = P_2 - P_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} - 
#     \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} =
#     \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},
# \end{align*}
# so the equation of $\ell_1$ is
# \begin{align*}
#     Q = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} t \\ 0 \\ 1 + t \end{pmatrix}.
# \end{align*}
# Doing similar for $\ell_2$ we have $P_1 = (0, 3, -1)$, $P_2 = (1, 3, -2)$ so

#     \mathbf{d} = \overrightarrow{P_1P_2} = P_2 - P_1 = 
#     \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} - 
#     \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 3 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} =
#     \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix},

# \begin{align*}
#     Q = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 3 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} t \\ 3 \\ -1 -t \end{pmatrix}.
# \end{align*}
# 
# (ii) &emsp; Notice that to verify if the two lines are parallel we do not need to know their equations, just their direction vectors. From [the definition of parallel lines](parallel-lines-definition), $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ are parallel if $\mathbf{d}_1 = k\mathbf{d}_2$, therefore
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} &= k
#     \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}

#         k = 1, \\
#         k = -1
#     \end{matrix}

# (ii) &emsp; Writing $\ell_1$ in vector form gives

#     \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},

# 
# so the direction vector is $\mathbf{d}_1 = (1, -1, 1)$. To find a direction vector perpendicular to $\mathbf{d}_1$, $\mathbf{d}_2$ say, we need to satisfy $\mathbf{d}_1 \cdot \mathbf{d}_2 = 0$

# \begin{align*}
#     \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}  \cdot \mathbf{d}_2 =

# 
# This equation has infinitely many solutions, to find a solution we need to choose values for any two from $d_1,d_2,d_3$ (where at least one is non-zero). Let $d_1 = 1$ and $d_2 = 0$ then $d_3 = -1$ so $\mathbf{d}_2 = (1, 0, -1)$. Since $\ell_2$ passes through $P = (-1, 1, 0)$ and the equation of $\ell_2$ is
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     Q = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + t
#     \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} =

# The notion of perpendicularity does not necessarily require that the lines intersect. The only condition is that the direction vectors of lines are perpendicular.
