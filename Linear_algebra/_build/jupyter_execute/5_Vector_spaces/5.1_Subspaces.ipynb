    "We have seen that a [vector space](vector-space-definition) is a set, and hence we can consider studying its [subsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset). Think of the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (which we think of with the usual $x,y,z$-coordinates). This is a vector space, and consider the plane $p = \\{(x,y,z) : x + y + z = 0\\} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3$. In fact, we can view $p$ itself as a vector space, meaning it satisfies the [vector space axioms](vector-space-axioms-theorem) A1 -- A4 and M1 -- M4, where we define addition and scalar multiplication as coming from $\\mathbb{R}^3$. We saw in [Co-ordinate geometry](coordinate-geometry-chapter) that this vector space $p$ actually closely resembles $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n",

    "Actually most of the [axioms](vector-space-axioms-theorem) A1 -- A4 and M1 -- M4 are automatically satisfied, simply because they're satisfied in $V$. The only things we really need to check are that addition and scalar multiplication are well-defined. In other words we need to check that when we 'add' or 'multiply' in $W$ we are not taken outside of $W$ ({numref}`vector-space-figure`). This idea is formalised in [the subspace condition](subspace-condition-theorem).\n",
