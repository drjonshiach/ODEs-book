## Coursework (50%)
 
This coursework assessment is intended to give students an opportunity to demonstrate what they have learned in the Linear Algebra and Programming Skills unit. This coursework consists of four questions, one of the questions will assess the linear algebra content and three of the questions will assess the programming skills content.

The examination is a 3 hour closed book examination which means you will not be permitted to take in any materials to help you in the examination. Proper preparation for the examination is essential so that you perform to the best of your ability. We will be spending a week towards the end of semester 1 consolidating the unit material and going through practice examination questions.

- Check through your answers to ensure you haven't made any silly errors and have answered all parts of the questions.
- Don't rush through the questions, take your time to ensure you have provided the answers requested by the question. 3 hours will give you plenty of time to answer the questions and check through your answers.
