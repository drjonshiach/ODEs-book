    "One way which we can solve systems of linear equations is using simple algebra. The usual approach is to try to solve for each unknown in turn by eliminating all of the other unknowns. For example, consider the linear system of equations from [example 2.1](system-of-linear-equations-matrix-form-example)\n",

    "we could eliminate $x_2$ be subtracting 3 times the first equation from the second to give\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ -2 x_1 = -2,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is easily solved to give $x_1 = 1$. Now that we know the value of $x_1$ we can substitute it into any equation in the system to give $x_2$. Substituting $x_1 = 1$ into the first equation gives\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 2(1) + x_2 = 4, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "so $x_2 = 2$. The solution should satisfy all equations in the system to checking that it also satisfies the second equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 4(1) + 3(2) = 10, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "so we know that $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 2$ is the solution. Whilst this approach is simple to implement for small systems of linear equations the algebra will soon become unwieldy for larger systems which is why we use the methods that are covered in this chapter."
