```{exercise}
:label: indirect-methods-ex-jacobi

Using a pen and calculator, calculate the first 2 iterations of the Jacobi method for solving the system of linear equations below. Use starting values of $x_i^{(0)} = 0 $ and work to 4 decimal places.

$$ \begin{align*}
    4x_1 +x_2 -x_3 +x_4 &=14,\\
    x_1 +4x_2 -x_3 -x_4 &=10,\\
    -x_1 -x_2 +5x_3 +x_4 &=-15,\\
    x_1 -x_2 +x_3 +3x_4 &=3.
\end{align*} $$

```{exercise} 
:label: indirect-methods-ex-gauss-seidel

Repeat {ref}`indirect-methods-ex-jacobi` using the Gauss-Seidel method.
```

```{exercise}
:label: indirect-methods-ex-sor

Repeat {ref}`indirect-methods-ex-jacobi` using the SOR method using the optimum value for the relaxation parameter.
```

```{exercise}
:label: indirect-methods-ex-convergence

Which of the three methods here would you expect to converge to the solution to the system from {ref}`indirect-methods-ex-jacobi` with the fewest iterations? What quantitative evidence do you have to support your conclusion?
```

```{exercise}
:label: indirect-methods-ex-code

Write a program to calculate the solution to the system of linear equations from {ref}`indirect-methods-ex-jacobi` using the Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel and SOR methods using a convergence tolerance of $tol=10^{-6}$. How many iterations did each of the three methods take to converge to the solution?
```

```{exercise}
:label: indirect-methods-ex-convergence-2

A linear system has the following coefficient matrix. What is the largest value that $\alpha$ can be in order for the Jacobi method to be convergent?

$$ \begin{align*}
    A = \begin{pmatrix}
        2 & 1 \\
        \alpha  & 2
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*} $$
