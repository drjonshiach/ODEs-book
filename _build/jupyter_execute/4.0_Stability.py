# ## Stable and unstable solutions
# 
# The Euler method has been applied to solve the following initial value problem using step lengths of $h = 0.25$ and $h = 0.125$
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     y' = -15y, \qquad t \in [0, 5], \qquad y(0) = 1.
# \end{align*}
# 
# The exact solution is $y = e^{-15t}$ and the numerical solutions are plotted against the exact solution in {numref}`stiff-solution-1`. Here we can see that the solution using $h = 0.125$ remains bounded whereas the solution using $h = 0.25$ diverges.

# 
# Stable and unstable solutions to the initial value problem $y' = -15y$, $t\in [0, 5]$ and $y(0) = 1$.
# ```
# 
# The solution using $h = 0.125$ is an example of a **stable** solution and the solution using $h = 0.25$ is an example of an **unstable** solution. The reason for the instability is due to the truncation of the Taylor series. We saw in the section on [error analysis](error-analysis-section) that the higher order terms that are omitted due to truncation causes a [local truncation error](lte-definition), $\tau$, and the accumulation of these local truncation errors creates the [global truncation error](gte-definition), $E$. If the local truncation error is too large then the global truncation error will eventually diverge as seen in {numref}`stiff-solution-1` causing the solution to be unusable. This provides us with the definition of stability.

# (stiffness-section)=
# ## Stiffness
# 
# Whether a numerical method used to solve an ODE is stable or unstable depends upon the ODE being solved and the step length used. A method could be stable for one ODE using a particular step length and unstable for another using the same step length. ODEs that require particularly small step length for a method to be stable are known as **stiff** ODEs. There is no mathematical definition of what makes an ODE stiff, however, J.D. Lambert provides a useful description
# 
# >*If a numerical method with a finite region of absolute stability, applied to a system with any initial conditions, is forced to use in a certain interval of integration a step length which is excessively small in relation to the smoothness of the exact solution in that interval, then the system is said to be stiff in that interval.*
# 
# ### Stiffness ratio
# 
# Consider a system of linear ODEs for the form
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     \mathbf{y}' = A \mathbf{y},
# \end{align*}
# 
# where $\mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n)^T$ and $A$ is an $n \times n$ matrix of constants. Let $V = (\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_n)$ be a matrix containing the [eigenvectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors) of $A$ then
# 
# $$V = (A \mathbf{v}_1, A \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, A \mathbf{v}_n).$$
# 
# Since $A \mathbf{v}_i = \lambda_i \mathbf{v}_1$ where $\lambda_i$ is the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvector $\mathbf{v}_i$ then
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     AV = (\lambda_1 \mathbf{v}_1, \lambda_2 \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \lambda_n \mathbf{v}_n) = V \Lambda
# \end{align*}
# 
# where $\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ (take care to make the distinction between $\Lambda$ which is the the uppercase $\lambda$ character and A). Multiplying both sides by $V^{-1}$ gives
# 
# $$V^{-1} A V = \Lambda,$$
# 
# which means that $V^{-1} A$ is a linear transformation that that **diagonalises** the matrix $A$. Let $\mathbf{u} = V^{-1} A \mathbf{y}$ then we have the transformed system $\mathbf{u}' = \Lambda \mathbf{u}$ which is
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     u_1' &= \lambda_1 u_1, \\
#     u_2' &= \lambda_2 u_2, \\
#     &\vdots \\
#     u_n' &= \lambda_n u_n.
# \end{align*}
# 
# Each equation in the transformed system has the solution $u_i = e^{\lambda_i t}$ so the fastest growing solution will be for the equation with the largest value of $\lambda$ and the slowest growing solution will be for the equation with the smallest value of $\lambda$. Stiffness occurs when there is a large variation in the solutions of equations in a system so we can gauge this by calculating the ratio between the largest and smallest eigenvalues of $A$. 
# 
# ````{admonition} Definition: stiffness ratio
# :class: note
# :name: stiffness-ratio-definition
# 
# The **stiffness ratio** for a system of ODEs of the form $\mathbf{y}' = A \mathbf{y}$ is
# ```{math}
# S = \frac{\max_i(|\lambda_i|)}{\min_i(|\lambda_i|)}
# ```
# where $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $A$.
# ````
# 
# If the stiffness ratio of a system of ODEs is large[^1] then the system is considered to be stiff. 
# 
# [^1]: What constitutes "large" is vague and subjective. As a rule of thumb if $S$ is in the hundreds or greater we can consider the system to be stiff. 
# 
# ````{admonition} Example 4.1
# :class: seealso
# 
# Determine the stiffness ration of the following ODE
# 
# $$ y'' + 1001 y' + 1000 y = 0.$$
# 
# **Solution**
# 
# Rewriting the second-order ODE as a system of two first-order ODEs
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     y_1' &= y_2, \\
#     y_2' &= -1000 y_1 - 1001 y_2.
# \end{align*}
# 
# which can be written as the matrix equation
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     \begin{pmatrix} y_1' \\ y_2' \end{pmatrix} =
#     \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1000 & -1001 \end{pmatrix}
#     \begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \end{pmatrix}.
# \end{align*}
# 
# Calculating the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     0 &= \begin{vmatrix} -\lambda & 1 \\ -1000 & -1001 - \lambda \end{vmatrix} 
#     = \lambda^2 + 1001 \lambda + 1000 = (\lambda + 1000) (\lambda + 1),
# \end{align*}
# 
# so the eigenvalues are $\lambda_1 = -1000$ and $\lambda_2 = -1$. The stiffness ratio is 
# 
# $$S = \frac{|-1000|}{|-1|} = 1000.$$
# 
# Since $S = 1000$ is large then this system is considered to be stiff. 
# ````
# 
# ### Solving stiff systems
# 
# To solve a stiff system we need to chose a numerical method that will be stable for a practical value of the step length. For example, the implicit Euler method (also known as the backward Euler method)
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     y_{n+1} = y_n + h f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1}),
# \end{align*}
# 
# and the solutions to the initial value problem $y' = -15y$, $t\in [0, 5]$ and $y(0) = 1$ using the Euler method and the implicit Euler method with $h=0.25$ are plotted in {numref}`stiff-solution-2`. 
# 
# ```{glue:figure} stiff_solution_2
# :name: stiff-solution-2
# 
# Solutions to the initial value problem $y' = -15y$, $t\in [0, 5]$ and $y(0) = 1$ using the Euler and implicit Euler method.
# ```
# 
# So if we were constrained with using a step length of $h=0.25$ then we could choose the implicit Euler method to solve this initial value problem.
