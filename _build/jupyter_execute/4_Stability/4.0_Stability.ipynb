    "The solution using $h = 0.125$ is an example of a **stable** solution and the solution using $h = 0.25$ is an example of an **unstable** solution. The reason for the instability is due to the truncation of the Taylor series. We saw in the section on [error analysis](error-analysis-section) that the higher order terms that are omitted due to truncation causes a [local truncation error](lte-definition), $\\tau$, and the accumulation of these local truncation errors creates the [global truncation error](gte-definition). If the local truncation error is too large then the global truncation error will eventually diverge as seen in {numref}`stiff-solution-1` causing the solution to be unusable. This provides us with the definition of stability. \n",
