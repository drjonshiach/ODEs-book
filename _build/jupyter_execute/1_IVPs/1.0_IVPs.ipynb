    "An Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) is an equation which contains the derivatives of a function e.g., $y(t)$, of a **single** independent variable $t$. ODEs occur in many different applications so it is important that we are able to solve them. Simple ODEs can be solved using **analytical** methods such as integration and Laplace transforms, however, the vast majority of ODEs used in the real world cannot be solved using analytical methods which is why we need a **numerical** approach.\n",
