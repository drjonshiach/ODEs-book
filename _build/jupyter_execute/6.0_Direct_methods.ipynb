    "\n",
    "[Systems of linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations) appear often in the topics of numerical analysis and numerical solutions to differential equations. Examples include the solution of the [stage values of an implicit Runge-Kutta method](solving-ivps-using-irk-methods-section) and the solution to a boundary value problem using the [finite-difference method](finite-difference-method-section). The methods that are applied to solve systems of linear equations fall into one of two categories: **direct methods** that use an algebraic approach and [**indirect methods**](indirect-methods-chapter) that use an iterative approach. On this chapter we will look at some common direct methods.\n",

    "- The system has a single unique solution.\n",
