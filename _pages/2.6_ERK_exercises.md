Answer the following exercises based on the content from this chapter. The solutions can be found in the [appendices](erk-solutions-section).

```{exercise}
:label: ch2-ex-eq-to-butcher

Write the following Runge-Kutta method in a Butcher tableau.
\begin{align*}
    y_{n+1} &=y_n +\frac{h}{6}(k_1 +4k_3 +k_4 ),\\
    k_1 &=f(t_n ,y_n ),\\
    k_2 &=f(t_n +\frac{1}{4}h,y_n +\frac{1}{4}hk_1 ),\\
    k_3 &=f(t_n +\frac{1}{2}h,y_n +\frac{1}{2}hk_2 ),\\
    k_4 &=f(t_n +h,y_n +h(k_1 -2k_2 +2k_3 )).

:class: note
:label: ch2-ex-butcher-to-eq

Write out the equations for the following Runge-Kutta method.
\begin{align*}\begin{array}{c|cccc}
    0 &  &  &  & \\
    1/4 & 1/4 &  &  & \\
    1/2 & -1/2 & 1 &  & \\
    1 & 1/4 & 0 & 3/4 & \\ \hline
    & 0 & 4/9 & 1/3 & 2/9

```{exercise}
:label: ch2-ex-rk3-order-conditions

Derive the order conditions for a third-order explicit Runge-Kutta method.
```

```{exercise}
:label: ch2-ex-myrk4-derivation

Derive an explicit fourth-order Runge-Kutta method where $c_2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $c_3 = \frac{1}{2}$ and $c_4 = 1$. (Hint: you may need to solve some of the order conditions separately to get Python and MATLAB to return a solution).
```

```{exercise}
:label: ch2-ex-myrk2-hand-calc

Using pen and paper, apply your Runge-Kutta method derived in {ref}`ch2-ex-myrk2-derivation` to solve the following initial value problem using a step length of $h=0.4$

\begin{align*}
    y' =t-y, \qquad t\in [0,2],\qquad y(0)=1
\end{align*}

Write your solutions correct to 4 decimal places.
```

```{exercise}
:label: ch2-ex-myrk2

Define a Python or MATLAB function called `myrk2()` which uses the method from derived in {ref}`ch2-ex-myrk2-derivation` to compute the solution over a single step. Use your function along with the [`solveIVP()`](euler-code-section) function to solve the initial value problem in {ref}`ch2-ex-myrk2-hand-calc`. Present your solution in a table and as a plot of the numerical solutions against the exact solutions on the same set of axes.
```

```{exercise}
:label: ch2-ex-myrk4

A third-order explicit Runge-Kutta method has the Butcher tableau

$$ \begin{array}{c|ccc}
    0 & 0 \\
    1/2 & 1/2 \\
    1 & -1 & 2 \\
    \hline
    & 1/6 & 2/3 & 1/6
\end{array} $$

Define two Python or MATLAB functions called `myrk3()` and `myrk4()` which uses this third-order method and the fourth-order method derived {ref}`ch2-ex-myrk4-derivation` to solve an initial value problem. Use your functions, along with your code from {ref}`ch2-ex-myrk2`, to solve the initial value problem in {ref}`ch2-ex-myrk2-hand-calc`. Present your solutions as a plot of the numerical solutions against the exact solution on the same set of axes.
```

```{exercise}
:label: ch2-ex-error-comparison

Use your functions `myrk2()`, `myrk3()` and `myrk4()` from {ref}`ch2-ex-myrk2` and {ref}`ch2-ex-myrk4` to solve the initial value problem from {ref}`ch2-ex-myrk2-hand-calc` using a range of step lengths starting at $h=0.4$ and halving each time until $h=0.025$. Plot the global truncation errors for the numerical solutions for the solution at $t=2$ against $h$ on a loglog scale and estimate the order of the three methods.
```

```{exercise}
:label: ch2-ex-rk23

Combining Heun's method and Kutta's third-order method gives the following Butcher tableau for an embedded Runge-Kutta method

$$ \begin{array}{c|ccc}
    0 & \\
    1/2 & 1/2 \\
    1 & -1 & 2 \\ \hline
    & 1/6 & 2/3 & 1/6 \\
    & 0 & 1 & 0 
\end{array}$$

where the first row of the $b$ coefficients gives the third-order accurate solution and the second row gives the second-order accurate solution. Define a function called `rk23()` that calculates the second and third order solutions over a single step and, along with the `solveIVP_SSC()` function from the section on [adaptive stepsize control](ssc-code-section), use it to solve the initial value problem from {ref}`ch2-ex-myrk2-hand-calc` using an initial step length of $h_0=0.4$ and an accuracy tolerance of $tol = 10^{-4}$. How many successful steps and failed steps were used?
