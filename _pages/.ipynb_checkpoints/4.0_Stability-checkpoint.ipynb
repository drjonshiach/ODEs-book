    "\n",
    "The stability of a numerical solver for ordinary differential equations refers to its ability to produce accurate and reliable solutions over a long interval, without the computed values of the solution becoming unbounded or oscillatory. In other words, a stable numerical solver for ODEs is one that does not produce solutions that blow up or oscillate wildly as time goes on.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the Euler method solution to the following initial value problem using step lengths of $h = 0.25$ and $h = 0.125$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y' = -15y, \\qquad t \\in [0, 1], \\qquad y(0) = 1. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact solution for this initial value problem is $y = e^{-15t}$ and the numerical solutions are plotted against the exact solution in {numref}`stability-plot-1-figure`. Here we can see that the solution using $h = 0.125$ remains bounded whereas the solution using $h = 0.25$ diverges.\n",

    "The solution using $h = 0.125$ is an example of a **stable** solution where the numerical solution remains bounded whereas the solution using $h = 0.25$ is an example of an **unstable** solution which is unbounded. The reason for the instability is due to the truncation of the Taylor series. We saw in the section on [error analysis](error-analysis-section) that the higher order terms that are omitted due to truncation causes a {prf:ref}`local truncation error<lte-definition>`, $\\tau$, and the accumulation of these local truncation errors creates the {prf:ref}`global truncation error<gte-definition>`. If the local truncation error is too large then the global truncation error will eventually diverge as seen in {numref}`stability-plot-1-figure` causing the solution to be unusable. This provides us with the definition of stability. \n",

    "## Stiffness\n",
    "\n",
    "The stability of a numerical solver for ODEs is closely related to the stiffness of the ODEs being solved. Stiff ODEs are those where the solution varies over several orders of magnitude or changes rapidly over a small interval, compared to the domain of the ODEs. In such cases, standard numerical solvers may produce inaccurate or unstable solutions if the time step used in the computation is not small enough to capture the fast dynamics of the problem.\n",

    ">*If a numerical method with a finite region of absolute stability, applied to a system with any initial conditions, is forced to use in a certain interval of integration a step length which is excessively small in relation to the smoothness of the exact solution in that interval, then the system is said to be stiff in that interval.*\n",
