    "- Indirect methods use an iterative approach to improve an estimate of the solution to a system of linear equations. The methods are iterated until the estimates have achieved the required accuracy.\n",
    "- The [Jacobi method](jacobi-method-section) is uses information from the previous iteration only to update the estimates.\n",
    "- The [Gauss-Seidel method](gauss-seidel-method-section) uses values of estimates already calculated in a given iteration to update the estimates. This means that the Gauss-Seidel method will converge to a solution faster than the Jacobi method.\n",
    "- An indirect method will [converge](convergence-of-indirect-methods-section) to the exact solution if the value of the spectral radius (the largest absolute eigenvalue) of the iteration matrix for a linear system is less than 1. \n",
    "- The smaller the value of the spectral radius, the faster the method will converge to the exact solution.\n",
    "- The [SOR method](sor-method-section) uses a relaxation parameter to adjust how much estimates will change over a single iteration. The value of the relaxation parameter is chosen to minimise the spectral radius."
